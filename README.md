# 📘 Tools Assignment 1 — HTML Lists & Navigation

This project is a simple **HTML-only assignment** that demonstrates:

- Creating **two separate pages** with navigation links  
- Using **`target="_blank"`** to open links in a new browser tab  
- Displaying **ordered lists (Roman numerals)** and **unordered lists (square bullets)**
